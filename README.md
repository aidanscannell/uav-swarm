# uav-swarm
Distributed software for a UAV swarm tracking a pollutant cloud.

Simulation.m is the main file containing the finite state machine that powers the simulation. The simNavDecision.m file contains the logic that enables the swarm to track the pollutant cloud and spread out along its boundary whilst avoiding collisions.
